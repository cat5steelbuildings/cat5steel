  <h1>Steel Building Referral Program</h1>
  <p><strong>Terms & Conditions</strong></p>

  <p>
    These Terms & Conditions govern participation in the Steel Building Referral Program.
    By submitting a referral, you acknowledge and agree to the following terms.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Program Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The Referral Program allows independent participants (“Referrers”) to earn a cash bonus
    for introducing qualified buyers who purchase a steel building through our company.
  </p>
  <p>
    Participation in this program does <strong>not</strong> create an employment,
    agency, partnership, or joint venture relationship.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Referral Bonus Amount</h2>
  <p>
    The total referral bonus is <strong>$500 per completed building</strong>, paid in two stages:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>$250 when the customer submits a deposit and the order is formally accepted</li>
    <li>$250 when construction begins (ground break, concrete pour, or building installation, as determined by the company)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Eligibility Requirements</h2>
  <p>To qualify for referral compensation:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The referral must be submitted <strong>before</strong> the buyer has any prior contact with our company</li>
    <li>The referral must include accurate buyer contact information</li>
    <li>The buyer must confirm the referrer’s introduction</li>
    <li>Only one referrer per buyer is eligible (first valid submission only)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Prohibited Referrals</h2>
  <p>The following referrals are not eligible:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Self-referrals</li>
    <li>Referrals involving a spouse, domestic partner, or immediate family member</li>
    <li>Referrals involving businesses owned or controlled by the referrer</li>
    <li>Fraudulent, misleading, or misrepresented referrals</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="note">
    Any attempt to abuse or manipulate the referral system may result in removal from the program
    and forfeiture of unpaid referral compensation.
  </div>

  <h2>5. Cancellations & Refunds</h2>
  <p>
    If a project is cancelled prior to construction beginning, no further referral compensation
    is owed beyond any amount already paid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Referral compensation may be required to be returned <strong>only</strong> if cancellation
    results from fraud, misrepresentation, or violation of these Terms & Conditions.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Payment Terms</h2>
  <p>
    Referral bonuses are paid only after qualifying milestones are met and all funds have cleared.
    Payment timing may vary based on banking, processing, or project scheduling.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Taxes</h2>
  <p>
    Referral bonuses are considered miscellaneous income. Referrers are solely responsible
    for reporting and paying any applicable taxes. A tax form may be issued if required by law.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Program Modifications</h2>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or terminate this Referral Program at any time,
    with or without notice.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>
    By submitting a referral, you acknowledge that you have read, understood,
    and agree to these Terms & Conditions.
